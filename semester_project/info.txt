The SCARE-Frontier

    Status: proposal
    Type: Semester
    Description:

    Although the field of side-channel-assisted reverse engineering (SCARE) in cryptography has seen a steady supply of works throughout the last decade, the first practical attack on undisclosed AES-like ciphers with hidden SubBytes, ShiftRows and MixColumns functions, verified on commodity hardware, was only recently proposed by Caforio et al. [1]. In this paper, the authors heavily relied on the newly introduced side-channel-assisted differential plaintext attack (SCADPA) methodology [2,3] that consists of an amalgamation of differential power analysis and the tools from conventional differential cryptanalysis.

    The resulting recovery procedures targeted straightforward, unprotected implementations of AES-like ciphers on both 8-bit and 32-bit architectures. However, increasingly, software implementations of cryptographic algorithms are being enriched with protective measures that aim to thwart side-channel attacks. In particular, shuffling and masking belong to the most commonly deployed techniques which were adopted by standardization agencies such as ANSSI [4]. Such protections are also conceivable for AES-like ciphers with secret components, and as such, would impede known reverse engineering endeavours. In this project, we investigate this last frontier of a practical SCADPA-based SCARE of secret AES-like algorithms that are protected by a set of known side-channel countermeasures.
